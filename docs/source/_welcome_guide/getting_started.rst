Getting started with ZnVis
--------------------------

The first steps to using ZnVis is the installation.
If you are using pip, it is a simple as:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install znvis

If you wish to install ZnVis from source, you may simply run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone https://github.com/zincware/ZnVis.git
   cd ZnVis
   pip install .

Once complete, you will be able to start using the visualizer by importing it as:

.. code-block:: python

   import znvis

With installation out of the way, head over to the example guides and start visualizing.
