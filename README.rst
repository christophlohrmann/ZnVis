ZnVis
-----
A visualisation engine for particle simulations.

ZnVis is a Python only visualization engine aimed at the live visualization of particle
simulation.
Simply define the particles in the simulation with details including their positions,
colour, direction, and shape, and the visualization engine will display the system
using the Open3D engine.

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^
ZnVis is a purely Python package hosted on PyPi.
It can therefore be installed with pip as:
